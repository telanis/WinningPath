# WinningPath
You and your friend decide to play a game. From a pile of stones, each player places 1-2 stones forming a tower. If there are no remaining stones on a turn, that player loses.  

This program prompts user for the amount of stones in the pile, then outputs all guaranteed winning paths (no matter what the enemy plays).
